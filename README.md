A programming language that starts as a minimal subset of Rust, designed to
explore cutting-edge compiler implementation techniques.

## About

Rue is an experimental programming language with Rust-like syntax that compiles
to native code. It focuses on modern compiler architecture including incremental
compilation using Salsa, IDE-first design with concrete syntax trees, and direct
ELF executable generation without external tooling.

The compiler supports both Cargo and Buck2 build systems.

## Current Status

The compiler is fully functional with a complete implementation pipeline from
lexing through native code generation. It includes an LSP server for IDE
integration and VS Code extension.

**Platform Support**: Linux x86-64 only

## Language Features

Current language support:
- Variables and assignment (let statements)
- Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
- Control flow (if/else, while loops)
- Functions with optional parameters
- All values are 64-bit signed integers

### Example Program

```rue
fn factorial(n) {
    if n <= 1 {
        1
    } else {
        n * factorial(n - 1)
    }
}

fn main() {
    factorial(5)  // Returns 120 as the exit code
}
```

## Building and Running

### Compile Rue programs

```bash
# Compile a program to executable
cargo run -p rue samples/simple.rue

# Run the compiled program (executable created in same directory as source)
./samples/simple; echo $?  # Shows the program's return value
```

### With Buck2

```bash
buck2 run //crates/rue:rue samples/simple.rue
./samples/simple; echo $?
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# With Cargo
cargo test                    # All tests
cargo test -p rue-lexer       # Just lexer tests
cargo test -p rue-parser      # Just parser tests

# With Buck2
buck2 test //crates/...       # All tests
buck2 test //crates/rue-lexer:test    # Just lexer tests
buck2 test //crates/rue-parser:test   # Just parser tests
```

## IDE Support

The language server provides syntax highlighting and error detection:

```bash
# Install VS Code extension
./install-extension.sh

# Start the language server for other editors
cargo run -p rue-lsp          # With Cargo
buck2 run //crates/rue-lsp    # With Buck2
```

See `crates/rue-lsp/README.md` for editor integration details.

## Development

See [docs/spec.md](./docs/spec.md) for the complete language specification and
[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for development guidance.
