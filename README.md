A programming language that starts as a minimal subset of Rust, designed to explore cutting-edge compiler implementation techniques.

**Platform Support**: Linux x86-64 only

## About

Rue is an experimental programming language that begins with a very small, simple subset of Rust syntax but focuses on modern compiler architecture:

- **Incremental compilation** using Salsa with expression-level granularity
- **IDE-first design** with concrete syntax trees that preserve all source information
- **ECS-inspired flat AST** with integer indices for memory efficiency
- **Dual build systems** supporting both Cargo and Buck2
- **x86-64 native code generation** targeting Linux ELF executables

## Current Status

ðŸŽ‰ **Fully Working Compiler** - Complete implementation:
- âœ… Complete lexer for all Rue language tokens
- âœ… Hand-written recursive descent parser with CST
- âœ… Salsa-based incremental compilation pipeline
- âœ… Comprehensive semantic analysis with error reporting
- âœ… x86-64 native code generation with direct ELF output
- âœ… LSP server for IDE integration
- âœ… VS Code extension with syntax highlighting and error detection
- âœ… Multi-crate workspace architecture with dual build systems

## Language Features (v0.1)

The initial version supports a minimal subset:
- **Variables**: All variables are 64-bit integers
- **Arithmetic**: Basic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
- **Control Flow**: if/else statements
- **Functions**: Single parameter, single return value
- **No explicit types**: Everything is implicitly i64

### Example Program

```rue
fn factorial(n) {
    if n <= 1 {
        1
    } else {
        n * factorial(n - 1)
    }
}

fn main() {
    factorial(5)  // Returns 120 as the exit code
}
```

## Building and Running

### Compile Rue Programs
```bash
# Build the compiler
cargo build -p rue

# Compile a rue program to native executable
cargo run -p rue samples/simple.rue

# Run the compiled program
./simple
echo "Exit code: $?"  # Shows the program's return value
```

### With Buck2
```bash
buck2 build //crates/rue:rue
buck2 run //crates/rue:rue samples/simple.rue
./simple
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Test specific components
cargo test -p rue-lexer
cargo test -p rue-parser
cargo test -p rue-semantic
cargo test -p rue-codegen
```

## IDE Support

Rue includes a complete Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for modern IDE integration:

### VS Code Extension
```bash
# Install the VS Code extension
./install-extension.sh

# Then open any .rue file to get:
# - Syntax highlighting
# - Real-time error detection
# - Auto-completion for brackets/quotes
```

### Other Editors
The LSP server works with any LSP-compatible editor:
```bash
# Start the language server
cargo run -p rue-lsp
```

See `crates/rue-lsp/README.md` for integration details.

## Development

- **Architecture**: See [spec.md](./spec.md) for complete language and implementation details
- **IDE Support**: See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for development guidance
- **Version Control**: This project uses jj (Jujutsu) instead of git
