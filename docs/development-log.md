# Development Log

## Session 1: Foundation Setup (June 2025)

### ✅ Major Accomplishments

1. **Multi-crate Architecture**
   - Set up 6-crate workspace: rue-ast, rue-lexer, rue-parser, rue-compiler, rue-codegen, rue (CLI)
   - Configured for Rust 2024 edition
   - Added Salsa 0.22 for incremental compilation

2. **Complete Lexer Implementation**
   - Tokenizes rue's minimal Rust subset
   - Supports integers, identifiers, keywords (fn, let, if, else), operators, delimiters
   - Comprehensive test coverage including factorial function parsing
   - Proper span tracking for error reporting

3. **Dual Build System Support**
   - Cargo workspace with proper dependencies
   - Buck2 + reindeer configuration working
   - Both systems build and run successfully

4. **Comprehensive CI/CD**
   - Main CI: Cargo & Buck2 builds, formatting, clippy across Rust stable/beta/nightly
   - Buck2 Extended: Detailed Buck2 validation
   - Cross-platform: Linux/macOS/Windows + cross-compilation
   - Documentation validation and benchmarks

5. **Project Infrastructure**
   - README.md with overview and build instructions
   - MIT/Apache 2.0 dual licensing
   - Complete spec.md with language definition
   - CLAUDE.md for development guidance

### 🔧 Current Issues Being Resolved
- CI checks being fixed (Buck2 installation, clippy on stable only, platform specifications)
- PR #1 open with foundational work

## Session 2: Parser Implementation (June 6, 2025)

### ✅ Major Accomplishments

1. **Complete CST-Based Parser**
   - Hand-written recursive descent parser for all rue v0.1 language features
   - IDE-friendly concrete syntax tree preserving all source information
   - Proper operator precedence: comparison < addition < multiplication < call < primary
   - Comprehensive error handling with span information

2. **Full Language Support**
   - Functions: `fn name(param) { body }`
   - Let statements: `let x = value`
   - If/else statements including else-if chains
   - Binary expressions: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `<=`
   - Function calls: `function(args)`
   - Literals and identifiers with parenthesized expressions

3. **Robust Testing Infrastructure**
   - 7 comprehensive test cases covering all language features
   - Factorial example from spec.md parses successfully
   - All tests pass: `test result: ok. 7 passed; 0 failed`

4. **Build System Integration**
   - Updated Cargo.toml dependencies for rue-ast and rue-parser
   - Manual Buck BUCK file updates for dependency management
   - Both Cargo and Buck2 builds verified working

5. **Architecture Decisions**
   - CST → Flat AST two-pass approach for IDE-first design
   - Traditional tree structure with clean abstractions (migration path to red/green trees)
   - Trivia handling ready for whitespace/comments
   - Token type unification using rue-lexer types directly

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details
- **Parser:** 360 lines of clean recursive descent implementation
- **AST Nodes:** 120 lines of well-structured CST definitions
- **Tests:** 230 lines covering all major language constructs
- **Integration:** Seamless lexer → parser → CST pipeline

### 🎯 Immediate Next Steps
1. **Flat AST Design** - ECS-inspired flat AST with integer indices for compilation
2. **CST → AST Lowering** - Transform IDE-friendly CST to compilation-optimized AST
3. **Salsa Integration** - Set up incremental compilation queries  
4. **Basic Semantic Analysis** - Type checking and name resolution

### 🏗️ Architecture Decisions Made
- ECS-inspired design with separate arrays for different AST node types
- Integer indices instead of pointers for memory efficiency
- Expression-level incremental compilation granularity
- IDE-first design with concrete syntax trees
- No traditional compiler/linker split

### 📝 Development Notes
- Using jj (Jujutsu) instead of git
- Buck2 requires platform specifications for audit commands
- dtolnay actions are more reliable than manual installations
- Clippy should only run on stable to avoid nightly variations

## Session 4: LSP and IDE Integration (June 10, 2025)

### ✅ Major Accomplishments

1. **Complete LSP Server Implementation**
   - Built `rue-lsp` crate with tower-lsp foundation
   - Real-time syntax error detection using existing parser
   - Document lifecycle management (open/change/close)
   - JSON-RPC protocol compliance for editor integration

2. **Full VS Code Extension**
   - Complete extension in `vscode-rue-extension/` directory
   - Syntax highlighting for all Rue language constructs
   - LSP client integration with automatic server startup
   - Language configuration with auto-completion features
   - Development and installation workflows

3. **Professional Development Experience**
   - Real-time error detection with red squiggly underlines
   - Syntax highlighting for keywords, operators, numbers
   - Auto-closing brackets and quotes
   - Works with any LSP-compatible editor (VS Code, Neovim, Emacs)

4. **Easy Installation and Testing**
   - `install-extension.sh` script for direct VS Code installation
   - Comprehensive documentation and setup guides
   - Test files and examples for validation

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details
- **LSP Server:** 200+ lines of async Rust using tokio and tower-lsp
- **VS Code Extension:** TypeScript implementation with proper launch configuration
- **Syntax Grammar:** TextMate grammar for comprehensive highlighting
- **Error Reporting:** Character-offset based diagnostics (can be enhanced to line/column)

### 🎯 Immediate Impact
- Rue now has **professional IDE support** comparable to major languages
- Developers get **immediate feedback** on syntax errors while typing
- Foundation for advanced features like completion, hover, go-to-definition
- Significantly improved developer experience for writing Rue programs

### 🏗️ Architecture Achievements
- Modular LSP design that can be extended with semantic features
- Clean separation between LSP server and VS Code client
- Reusable patterns for other editor integrations
- Foundation for future language server enhancements

### 📝 Session 4 Notes
- LSP protocol requires proper Content-Length headers for JSON-RPC
- VS Code extensions need `.vscode/launch.json` for F5 development workflow
- TypeScript LanguageClient API uses stop()/start() not restart()
- Character offset diagnostics work but line/column would be more user-friendly
