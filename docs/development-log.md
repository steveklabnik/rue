# Development Log

## Session 1: Foundation Setup (June 2025)

### ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments

1. **Multi-crate Architecture**
   - Set up 6-crate workspace: rue-ast, rue-lexer, rue-parser, rue-compiler, rue-codegen, rue (CLI)
   - Configured for Rust 2024 edition
   - Added Salsa 0.22 for incremental compilation

2. **Complete Lexer Implementation**
   - Tokenizes rue's minimal Rust subset
   - Supports integers, identifiers, keywords (fn, let, if, else), operators, delimiters
   - Comprehensive test coverage including factorial function parsing
   - Proper span tracking for error reporting

3. **Dual Build System Support**
   - Cargo workspace with proper dependencies
   - Buck2 + reindeer configuration working
   - Both systems build and run successfully

4. **Comprehensive CI/CD**
   - Main CI: Cargo & Buck2 builds, formatting, clippy across Rust stable/beta/nightly
   - Buck2 Extended: Detailed Buck2 validation
   - Cross-platform: Linux/macOS/Windows + cross-compilation
   - Documentation validation and benchmarks

5. **Project Infrastructure**
   - README.md with overview and build instructions
   - MIT/Apache 2.0 dual licensing
   - Complete spec.md with language definition
   - CLAUDE.md for development guidance

### üîß Current Issues Being Resolved
- CI checks being fixed (Buck2 installation, clippy on stable only, platform specifications)
- PR #1 open with foundational work

### üéØ Immediate Next Steps
1. **Parser Implementation** - Hand-written recursive descent parser
2. **AST Definitions** - ECS-inspired flat AST with integer indices  
3. **Salsa Integration** - Set up incremental compilation queries
4. **Basic Semantic Analysis** - Even though everything is i64

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions Made
- ECS-inspired design with separate arrays for different AST node types
- Integer indices instead of pointers for memory efficiency
- Expression-level incremental compilation granularity
- IDE-first design with concrete syntax trees
- No traditional compiler/linker split

### üìù Development Notes
- Using jj (Jujutsu) instead of git
- Buck2 requires platform specifications for audit commands
- dtolnay actions are more reliable than manual installations
- Clippy should only run on stable to avoid nightly variations
