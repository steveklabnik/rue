# Session 2: Parser Implementation

**Date:** June 6, 2025  
**Focus:** Complete CST-based parser implementation with comprehensive tests

## Major Accomplishments

### ✅ Complete Parser Architecture
- **CST-first approach:** Built concrete syntax tree that preserves all source information
- **IDE-friendly design:** All tokens, spans, and structure preserved for future IDE features
- **Clean abstractions:** Ready to migrate to red/green trees if needed later
- **Proper error handling:** ParseError with span information

### ✅ Full Language Support
Implemented parsing for all rue v0.1 language features:
- **Functions:** `fn name(param) { body }`
- **Let statements:** `let x = value`
- **If/else statements:** Including else-if chains
- **Binary expressions:** Proper operator precedence (comparison < addition < multiplication)
- **Function calls:** `function(args)`
- **Literals and identifiers**
- **Parenthesized expressions**

### ✅ Integration & Dependencies
- **Lexer integration:** Reused existing lexer tokens, updated AST to use rue-lexer types
- **Cargo.toml updates:** Added rue-lexer dependency to rue-ast
- **Buck build system:** Updated BUCK files, verified builds work with both Cargo and Buck2
- **Clean module structure:** rue-ast defines CST nodes, rue-parser handles parsing logic

### ✅ Comprehensive Testing
Implemented 7 test cases covering:
- Simple literals and identifiers
- Binary expressions with correct precedence
- Function calls with arguments
- Let statements
- Simple function definitions
- **Full factorial example** - parses the complete factorial function from spec.md

### ✅ Design Decisions Made

**Parser Strategy:**
- Recursive descent parser consuming tokens sequentially
- Traditional tree structure with clean abstractions
- Trivia (whitespace/comments) attached to nodes as leading/trailing
- Error recovery with ParseError containing span information

**AST Design:**
- CST preserves all source information for IDE features
- TokenNode as type alias to rue-lexer::Token for consistency
- Separate node types for each language construct
- Proper Box usage for recursive structures

**Integration:**
- Chose CST → Flat AST approach (two-pass compilation)
- Parser produces CST, future lowering step will create compilation-optimized AST
- Both Cargo and Buck2 build systems supported

## Code Structure

### New Files Created
- `crates/rue-ast/src/lib.rs` - CST node definitions (120 lines)
- `crates/rue-parser/src/lib.rs` - Complete parser implementation (590 lines)
- Comprehensive test suite covering all language features

### Modified Files
- `crates/rue-ast/Cargo.toml` - Added rue-lexer dependency
- `crates/rue-ast/BUCK` - Added rue-lexer dependency for Buck builds

## Test Results
```
running 7 tests
test tests::test_binary_expression ... ok
test tests::test_function_call ... ok
test tests::test_let_statement ... ok
test tests::test_simple_function ... ok
test tests::test_simple_identifier ... ok
test tests::test_simple_number ... ok
test tests::test_factorial_example ... ok

test result: ok. 7 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

## Build Verification
- ✅ Cargo builds and tests pass
- ✅ Buck2 builds all rue crates successfully
- ✅ Both build systems work with new dependencies

## Next Steps (For Future Sessions)

### 1. Flat AST Design
- Design compilation-optimized AST with integer indices
- ECS-inspired storage with separate arrays for different node types
- String interning for identifiers

### 2. CST → AST Lowering
- Implement conversion from CST to flat AST
- Lose trivia but preserve span information for errors
- Handle name resolution and scoping

### 3. Salsa Integration
- Set up Salsa database
- Make file parsing an incremental query
- Expression-level change tracking

### 4. Semantic Analysis
- Type checking (everything is i64, but still validate)
- Name resolution and scope analysis
- Function signature validation

## Technical Notes

### Parser Architecture Decisions
- **Why CST first:** Preserves all information for IDE features, easier error recovery
- **Why traditional trees:** Simpler than red/green, can migrate later if needed
- **Why recursive descent:** Hand-written parsers are easier to debug and extend

### Integration Challenges Solved
- **Token type mismatches:** Updated parser to use lexer's TokenKind enum directly
- **Dependency management:** Both Cargo and Buck builds working correctly
- **Span handling:** Proper error reporting with source locations

### Key Design Patterns
- **Parser combinator style:** Methods that return ParseResult<T>
- **Visitor-friendly AST:** Easy to traverse for future compilation phases
- **Error propagation:** ? operator throughout for clean error handling

## Performance Notes
- Parser handles factorial example (complex nested structure) without issues
- Memory usage reasonable for CST approach
- Ready for incremental compilation integration with Salsa

## Quality Metrics
- **Test coverage:** All major language features covered
- **Error handling:** Proper ParseError with spans for debugging
- **Code organization:** Clean separation between AST definitions and parsing logic
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive session notes and inline comments where needed

This session successfully established the parsing foundation for rue, with a clean architecture ready for the next phase of compiler development.
