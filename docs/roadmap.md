## Compiler Infrastructure Roadmap

### Performance Optimization
- **SSA-based IR**: Static Single Assignment intermediate representation
- **Optimization passes**: Dead code elimination, constant folding, etc.
- **Register allocation**: Efficient CPU register usage
- **LLVM backend**: Alternative high-performance backend

### Platform Support
- **Windows support**: PE executable generation

- **ARM64 support**: Apple Silicon and server ARM
- **WebAssembly target**: Browser and serverless deployment

### Development Experience
- **Incremental compilation**: File-level and module-level caching
- **Parallel compilation**: Multi-threaded compilation pipeline
- **IDE improvements**: Better autocomplete, refactoring, debugging
- **Package registry**: Central package repository

### Debug and Profiling
- **DWARF debug info**: GDB/LLDB integration
- **Built-in profiler**: Performance analysis tools

- **Trace generation**: Execution flow visualization

## Research and Exploration Areas

### Cutting-Edge Compiler Techniques
- **Query-based compilation**: Further Salsa integration
- **Persistent data structures**: Immutable AST representations
- **Parallel semantic analysis**: Multi-threaded type checking
- **Incremental linking**: Fast executable regeneration

### Language Design Experiments
- **Effect systems**: Tracking side effects in the type system
- **Dependent types**: Types that depend on values
- **Linear types**: Resource management through the type system
- **Capability-based security**: Fine-grained permission systems

### Integration Experiments
- **Build system integration**: Treating functions as build targets
- **Hot reloading**: Live code updates during development
- **Distributed compilation**: Network-based compilation clusters
- **IDE-compiler fusion**: Deeper editor integration

## Timeline Estimates

- **v0.2**: Multiple parameters, comments, basic I/O (2-3 months)
- **v0.3**: Multiple data types, arrays, better tooling (3-4 months)
- **v0.4**: Structs, enums, pattern matching (4-6 months)
- **v0.5**: Generics, traits, advanced features (6-8 months)
- **v1.0**: Ownership system, full language (12-18 months)

## Success Metrics

### Language Adoption
- **Developer satisfaction**: Easy learning curve and good ergonomics
- **Performance competitiveness**: Comparable to C/Rust for systems programming
- **Ecosystem growth**: Package ecosystem and community contributions
- **Production usage**: Real-world applications built with Rue

### Technical Excellence
- **Compilation speed**: Sub-second compilation for medium projects
- **Runtime performance**: Within 10% of equivalent C/Rust code
- **Memory safety**: Zero-cost abstractions with safety guarantees
- **IDE experience**: Best-in-class development environment

## Open Questions

### Language Design
- How aggressive should type inference be?
- Should Rue have garbage collection or ownership?
- What memory model should concurrent Rue use?
- How should Rue handle errors (exceptions, Result types, etc.)?

### Implementation Strategy  
- When to introduce LLVM vs. continue custom backend?
- How to balance compilation speed vs. runtime performance?
- Should Rue target existing packaging ecosystems (cargo, npm)?
- How to maintain incremental compilation with advanced features?

### Community and Ecosystem
- What governance model for language evolution?
- How to bootstrap a package ecosystem?
- What industries/domains to target first?
- How to balance innovation with stability?
