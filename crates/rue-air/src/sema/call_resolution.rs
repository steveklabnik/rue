//! Call / method / operator / module-member resolution for exact-one-body
//! analysis.
//!
//! Family 1C of the RUE-1091 analyzer rewire (slice r1b). The free-function,
//! method, operator-overload, and module-member reads that `analysis.rs`,
//! `calls.rs`, `ownership.rs`, and `builtin_ops.rs` perform while resolving a
//! call, method, or operator to its callee no longer touch the semantic epoch
//! tables directly. They flow through [`CallResolutionFacts`] — the
//! value/call-world analog of [`crate::SemanticTypeSyntaxProvider`] and a
//! sibling of `body_endpoint`'s [`super::body_endpoint::BodyEndpointProvider`]
//! (family 1A) — so the selection *logic* is provider-generic and a later slice
//! can supply the same facts from a body-fact provider + overlay instead of the
//! epoch `Sema`.
//!
//! [`EpochFacts`] is the one production implementation: each operation is the
//! verbatim epoch-table read the inline analyzer code performed, so the hoist is
//! byte-identical. Every operation is `&self` and returns owned or `Copy` data,
//! so a caller inside an `&mut Sema` stack constructs a short-lived
//! [`EpochFacts`] per resolution (mirroring `SemaTypeSyntaxProvider`) without
//! retaining a borrow across the surrounding mutations.
//!
//! Where the analyzer selects a winner across *several* candidate reads — the
//! reachability classifier's free-function-then-named-method order, and the
//! static call-reference resolver's const-alias-then-local order — that
//! selection lives in the provider-generic free functions below
//! ([`classify_static_call`], [`resolve_static_call_reference`]) rather than in
//! the impl, so both `EpochFacts` and a future body-fact impl replay the exact
//! same candidate order, short-circuits, and first-match-wins tie-breaks
//! (RUE-1091 risk R1). Winner-picking that a single epoch accessor already
//! performs internally (`method_info`'s anonymous-then-named fallback, the
//! callable-symbol single-candidate check) stays inside that point query,
//! matching the `body_endpoint` convention.

// `ProviderCallFacts` — the call-resolution ProviderFacts (RUE-1091 slice r4b-1).
//
// The first provider-driven realization of the family-1C call/method/operator
// facts: where [`EpochFacts`] answers each op from the semantic epoch's
// `Sema` tables, this driver answers them from the exact body-fact provider
// boundary ([`BodyFactProvider`], realized in production by rue-compiler's
// `CompilerBodyFactProvider`) plus the body-scoped identity pool (slices
// 2a/2b/2c). It is the value/call analog of r2's `ProviderTypeFacts`: the fact
// SOURCE differs, the assembled answers (`FunctionInfo`/`MethodInfo`/…) are the
// already-published identity types a differential compares against the epoch.
//
// RUE-1091 flip-era surface: `pub` because rFinal's whole-body differential and
// the step-4 flip both drive the provider path from rue-compiler, where the
// pool's durable source is built from concrete nucleus signatures (an opaque
// `BodyFactProvider` associated type rue-air cannot destructure). The sole
// pre-flip caller is the rue-compiler differential; the flip promotes it to the
// production analyzer. Every method here is a thin composition — pool consult
// (P), provider point query (C/B), or RIR-index handle fill — with no resolution
// LOGIC of its own (selection stays in [`classify_static_call`] /
// [`resolve_static_call_reference`], the provider-generic free functions above).
//
// Feasibility (r4a design-checkpoint table): P = answered-by-pool, C =
// composed-from-existing-ops, B = boundary-op.
//   - function_info / method_info / named_method_info                 → P
//   - named_method_declaration                                        → P (BodyRirIndex)
//   - named_method_by_callable_symbol                                 → B (callable_symbol_method)
//   - function_contains / resolve_function_name_local                 → C (lookup)
// Disposition (updated by slice r4b-3, which owned this backlog):
//   - method_info / named_method_info → LANDED (r4b-3). The receiver preimage
//     `(owner_file, owner_type_name)` threads through the durable method key: the
//     inherent `method_info` composes the pool's durable method subset (receiver
//     through 2a) with the RIR handle the RIR index locates for the preimage. The
//     rue-compiler differential recovers the receiver by joining the method key's
//     `owner()` back to the owner nominal's durable key.
//   - value_const / module_binding / resolve_const_info_in_file → RE-DEFERRED to
//     the flip. Sharpened reason: a `ConstInfo` carries both a declaration `span`
//     the position-free provider boundary omits (needs a const-declaration RIR
//     handle — the const twin of the function/method handles) AND a
//     comptime-evaluated `value` the durable const payload carries but the body
//     identity pool has no const-minting arm for yet. Both are flip-slice work.
//   - module_def → RE-DEFERRED to the flip. Sharpened reason: it answers a
//     rue-air-internal `ModuleId` registry index the provider has no durable
//     preimage for; the module-facts + logical-path composition an equivalent
//     could be built from belongs with the flip's module registry.
//   - named_method_declaration → LANDED (flip-prep). Both seams now take the
//     provider-natural `(owner_file, owner_type_name, method_name)` preimage;
//     the epoch adapter alone translates it through `structs_by_file_name` to
//     the epoch map's `(StructId, method_name)` key.
//   - source_function_name under specialization → r5 (the specialization name
//     map); identity otherwise.
