//! RUE-1086 — two-dimensional scaling and warm/fresh correctness harness.
//!
//! This harness gates on *structural work counters*, never wall time. It varies
//! two axes of the semantic workload independently — the number of reached
//! function bodies and the number of unrelated (never-called) declarations — and
//! reads the per-body declaration-context counters plumbed onto
//! [`BodyAnalysisWork`] (`per_body_declaration_context`) plus the ordinary
//! binding/manifest/body counters that already exist on
//! [`CanonicalSemanticWork`].
//!
//! Wall-time, allocation-count, and peak-memory measurement live in a *separate*
//! opt-in binary, `//crates/rue-scaling-bench`, so they never mix with these
//! counter assertions. See that crate's module docs for the reproducible runner
//! command lines and the recorded-baseline provenance.
//!
//! # What it proves
//!
//! 1. Deterministic synthetic corpus varying reached-body count and
//!    unrelated-declaration count independently.
//! 2. Scaling rows (counter-based): fixed bodies / growing declarations, and
//!    fixed declarations / growing bodies.
//! 3. Two-revision invalidation rows asserted via counters and one shared
//!    warm-vs-fresh parity oracle used by *every* edit row.
//! 4. Specialization rows (breadth compiles, depth fails E1200), referencing the
//!    canonical boundary unit tests rather than duplicating them.
//! 5. A warm-vs-fresh parity oracle after every edit row.
//!
//! # The two-envelope expected-failure discipline
//!
//! Most long-lived expected-failure rows use [`Row::envelope`], which asserts
//! either a repaired target envelope or a documented known-bad witness. RUE-1090
//! is intentionally different: it is a post-identity-cut decision gate, so it
//! compares observed baseline and grown per-body counters directly.
//!
//! * **(a) the repaired target envelope** — the measured value at or below the
//!   flat/linear/incremental target (within a tight tolerance). This is a hard
//!   PASS. A repair *better* than the target still passes; the envelope never
//!   panics on an improvement.
//! * **(b) the documented unrepaired witness** — the measured value inside a
//!   *tight* band around the structurally predicted known-bad shape (e.g. per
//!   body prepare/install growing 1:1 with the declaration universe). This is a
//!   tracked expected-failure naming its issue.
//!
//! Anything **worse** than the witness band (e.g. duplicate body analyses, or a
//! warm recompute worse than a full fresh one), or **structurally between** the
//! two envelopes (a partial repair that is neither flat nor the documented
//! witness), FAILS the test so a human reconciles the row with the new reality.
//! The witnesses are predicted from the corpus knobs, not copied from a prior
//! run, so an unrelated regression that inflates the counters still fails loudly.
//!
//! Tracking issues, each named at its row:
//!
//! * **RUE-1089** — identity rows: per-body identity/lookup installation work
//!   should be invariant to unrelated-declaration count.
//! * **RUE-1091** — conditional shared-base / narrow-epoch repair: activated by
//!   RUE-1090 if per-body install/project/endpoint work grows with unrelated
//!   declarations; its edit-invalidation rows remain expected-failure evidence.
//! * **RUE-1090** — measurement gate: fixed bodies / growing declarations must
//!   leave observed per-body project/install/endpoint work flat.
//!
//! # Stage-source counter provenance
//!
//! The per-body declaration-context counters are accrued INSIDE
//! `analyze_body_query`, at each stage's own source, as the stage actually
//! performs the work (see `canonical_semantic.rs`). The coordinator no longer
//! charges them from the input slice lengths it happens to hold, and a body that
//! fails before install is not charged for installation it never performed. A
//! shortcut added inside any stage (a shared base that predeclares fewer shells,
//! a projection that reuses cached exports) therefore drops the corresponding
//! counter, and this harness observes it.
//!
//! # Reference host and recorded prediction
//!
//! The recorded structural baselines below were captured on the CI/dev host; the
//! `//crates/rue-scaling-bench` runner prints `nproc`, total memory, and the
//! commit hash at run time so any wall-time/allocation/memory baseline is
//! attributable to a concrete host and revision.
//!
//! Two distinct Caldera figures must not be conflated (ADR-0066 §3, RUE-1086
//! provenance in `docs/benchmarks/rue-1086-caldera-baseline.json`):
//!
//! * **~62% of cold wall time at Caldera scale** — the frozen ADR-0066 recorded
//!   prediction, restored verbatim: the per-body *install/project/endpoint*
//!   term. This is the `O(bodies × declarations)` share this harness gates on.
//! * **~85% total per-body setup share** — a *separate* number: the total
//!   per-body setup share (install/project/endpoint **plus** prepare and
//!   config), measured via the 200-sample stack profile. It is not the 62%
//!   prediction and is stated only as the total-setup context around it.
//!
//! Caldera measurement provenance (RUE-1083): base cutover commit 586f50c,
//! measured at commit aca4acb, release build (`--target-platforms
//! //platforms:release`), linux x64, `RUE_STD_PATH` set, 200 gdb stack samples
//! at 0.25s intervals plus per-stage `--time-passes` spans over
//! `examples/caldera/main.rue`. The full machine-readable record — including
//! this host's configuration and the per-sample raw evidence — is checked in at
//! `docs/benchmarks/rue-1086-caldera-baseline.json`. The ~45 ms *pre-link*
//! target is an eventual reference-host goal, not a current gate.
//!
//! ## Recorded structural baseline (stage-sourced counters)
//!
//! Single-file corpus, no std import, so the declaration universe is exactly
//! `reached_bodies + unrelated_decls + 1` (`main`) and `cold_bodies` is exactly
//! `reached_bodies + 1`:
//!
//! With `U = reached_bodies + unrelated_decls + 1`, per-body prepare, project,
//! and install each equal `U`, per-body endpoints equal `2·U + 1` (one stable
//! definition endpoint and one body-owner endpoint per declaration plus one
//! module endpoint), and total prepare work is `cold_bodies · U`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   bodies × decls | cold_bodies per_body_shells per_body_project per_body_semantics per_body_endpoints shells_total
//!     100 ×   100  |        101            201              201                201                403          20301
//!    1000 ×   100  |       1001           1101             1101               1101               2203        1102101
//! ```
//!
//! per-body prepare/project/install grow 1:1 with the universe and endpoints
//! grow 2:1. These are retained as historical predictions in the RUE-1090 audit
//! output, but the gate itself compares the observed baseline and grown values:
//! the post-identity-cut constant may change while remaining flat.
